**Description**

A data analysis case study using R and the Tidyverse. It uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle [SuperStore DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales/data).

This project includes several files:

- *e-Commerce-Sales-Analysis.html*
    - This html file contains the knit output of the R Markdown file in a portable and easily viewable format.
      - This document walks through the entire process of the analysis.
      - First the data is loaded and examined then data cleaning and pre-processing is completed.
      - Then the cleaned data is analyzed using statistical and visual approaches.
      - Finally the insights gained are summarized and recommendations are provided.
To improve clarity and focus on the analysis code snippets are hidden by default, but can be viewed using the "Show" buttons to the right. 
- *e-Commerce Sales Analysis.Rproj*
    - The R Studio project file
- *e-Commerce Sales Analysis.Rmd*
